    <p id="ranColor">The Crystal Gems are a team of magical beings who are the self-appointed guardians of the universe. Half-human, half-Gem
        hero Steven is the "little brother" of the group. The goofball is learning to save the world using the magical powers
        that come from his bellybutton and he goes on magical adventures with the rest of the Crystal Gems, even though he's
        not as powerful -- or smart -- as fellow group members Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl. Despite his shortcomings, Steven
        usually finds a surprising way to save the day.</p>
